# Plotting phasors on gauss plane

      from complex_plane import complex_plane2
      
if you have a complex number c1:

      complex_plane2([c1])
      
plot number on gauss plane

if you have a series of complex number c1, c2, c3, ...:

      complex_plane2([c1,c2,c3,...])
      
plot numbers on a gauss plane
